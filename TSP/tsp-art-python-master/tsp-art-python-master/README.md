# Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) Art in Python

The intention of this repo is to provide a beginner-programmer-friendly way to enable people to make their own TSP Art using Python, where you can put in any image and generate a version made purely out of dots, and then another version that connects all these dots in a single continuous line where the end points meet each other.

The following is written assuming a system with Windows 10. Pull requests are welcome for Linux and MacOS.

# Outline of Algorithm

There are two major steps to the algorithm:

1. Stippling (or 'pointillism') - the image is represented by small black dots of identical size in a way such that darker areas have more dots clustered closely together than lighter areas. The algorithm used here is called 'weighted voronoi stippling'.

2. Determining and drawing the Travelling Salesman Problem Path - the [Travelling Salesman Problem](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) is a classic mathematical optimisation problem where given a list of locations, we are to find a single path that travels through all the locations only once and returns to the starting point. Here we use the dots drawn in the first step as our locations and use an algorithm to determine then draw an appropriate path.

# Requirements

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - you should also know how to use the console/command prompt, and run/execute a Python script. Note that command line options might be different for those using Anaconda.
* Optional: [Concorde TSP Solver](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde/index.html) 
* Optional: [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* Optional: Image editing program. Free/open-source ones: [Krita](https://krita.org/en/), [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)

And lastly, the image(s) that you want to convert! 

## Python Dependencies

* Pillow
* ortools (Note that this requires [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019, which can be found at the bottom of this link.](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?q=Visual+C%2B%2B+Redistributable+for+Visual+Studio))
* tqdm
* imageio
* scipy
* matplotlib

## What kind of images should I use for best results?

**Format:** This will work for the common image formats (`.jpg`, `.png`). More obscure image formats might have some issues, so I'd recommend converting them to `.jpg` or `.png` first.

**Type**: Generally you'll want to use images that is a single object against a white background. Colour doesn't matter as much since the image is converted to grayscale as part of the stippling process.

Three images are provided for you in the `images` folder for you to practise on and to observe results. The scripts are initially configured to use `smileyface-inverted.png` in the `images` folder, and you can get an idea of what the output might look like if you check the `example-output` folder.

# Producing Your TSP Art

For reference, we'll assume that the initial image is `figure.png` which is placed in the `images` folder, making the filename `images/figure.png'. Replace `figure.png` with whatever other images that you also place in the `images` folder.

## 0. Setup 

Download the repository by clicking the green 'Code' button, then select 'Download ZIP' and unzip to the folder of your choice. Alternatively if you have Git installed, `git clone https://github.com/matthras/tsp-art-python` into the folder of your choice.

Install the required Python libraries by typing into the console: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Alternatively, manually install the Python dependencies as listed above. If you know how to setup a Python environment feel free to do that first.

## 1. Image Preprocessing (and potential problems!)

Skip this step if you're a first timer. This step will only be relevant after you've run through a few images and want to tweak things a little, or have run into certain problems.

**Images with transparent backgrounds**: You'll want to colour these backgrounds white in your image-editing program, as some transparent backgrounds are set to black by default.

**Difficult to distinguish sections of similar colour/shade**: You may have seen this when trying out `croissant-emoji.png`. There's two ways to deal with this: one is to increase the number of dots available. The other is to increase the contrast or recolour sections appropriately using your image editing program. 

**Compression noise/grain/artefacts**: Sometimes your initial image might not necessarily be smooth, or you'll see 'bits that aren't supposed to be there'. These vary a huge amount so there's no one surefire method for dealing with all of them. I know there are built-in methods in GIMP/Krita/Photoshop for dealing with them, but am no expert - usually the examples I work with are simple enough to manually clean using Brush and Fill tools. 

## 2. Stippling

Open up `stippling.py` in the editor of your choice, and change the `ORIGINAL_IMAGE` variable to the folder and image that you wish to stipple. So if our image is `figure.png` located in the `images` folder, you'd rename the variable to `"images/figure.png"`

What should happen on your first time: 

* the console should show something similar to a progress bar, showing each iteration on a new line
* a window will pop up and show the dots arranging themselves
* closing aforementioned window will finish the script, and you should see two new files in the `images` folder: 
  * `figure-1024-stipple.png` which is a stippled version of your original image, and
  * `figure-1024-stipple.tsp` which is a record of the coordinates of each of the points. This is the file we need for the next step. 

Note: `1024` refers to the number of dots used, assuming you use the initial settings as given. If you change this number, the resulting filenames will also have their numbers changed. This is to make it easier to experiment with different numbers of dots without constantly having to delete the old files.

## 3. Acquiring & Drawing the TSP Solution

### Using OR-Tools in Python

Open `draw-tsp-path.py` in your editor, and change the variables as follows:

* `ORIGINAL_IMAGE` should be the stippled image you obtained for Step 2: `images/figure-1024-stipple.png`
* `IMAGE_TSP` should refer to the stipple `.tsp` file that is generated after Step 2: `images/figure-1024-stipple.tsp`

Run the file, wait for Python to do its job and when it's done, the final image will be generated as `images/figure-1024-tsp.png`.

### Using Concorde (Windows GUI)

Open Concorde either by double clicking on `figure-1024-stipple.tsp` or opening the program separately and then loading `figure-1024-stipple.tsp` file into it. Concorde should then display a series of dots that should resemble what you see in `figure-1024-stipple.png`.

In the menu, click on 'Heuristics', select 'Lin Kernighan', then click OK. Concorde will then generate a tour that goes through all the points and returns to the starting point.

Save the tour as a file by selecting in the menu: `File > Save Tour`. In our example we'll save it as `figure-tour.cyc`.

Open `draw-tsp-path-concorde.py` in your editor and change the filenames at the top of the file

* `ORIGINAL_IMAGE` should be the same initial image you used for Step 2: `images/figure-1024-stipple.png`
* `IMAGE_TSP` should refer to the stipple `.tsp` file that is generated after Step 2: `images/figure-1024-stipple.tsp`
* `IMAGE_CYC` should refer to the `.cyc` file that is generated from Concorde: `images/figure-tour.cyc`

Run the file and the script should generate the final image at `images/figure-1024-tsp.png`.

#### When do I use Concorde over OR-Tools?

Generally speaking you'll only want to use Concorde over OR-Tools if you have an image that has 'gaps' where you don't want a path to cross. Sometimes the OR-Tools algorithm may result in paths that 'cross-over' areas where you don't want them to, whereas the Concorde solver is less likely to achieve such a result.

To demonstrate as an example, in the `example-output` folder we have a `smileyface-inverted.png`:

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/example-output/smileyface-inverted.png" width="300"></div>

Now compare the two results (look closely at the mouth to see the difference):

Python | Concorde
:-----:|:--------:
![](/example-output/smileyface-inverted-1024-tsp%20%28Python%29.png) | ![](/example-output/smileyface-inverted-1024-tsp%20%28Concorde%29.png)
